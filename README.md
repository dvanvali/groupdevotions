## Install

Start by installing npm and bower (if they are not in your path, you will need to hunt down the bin directory):

```shell
sudo npm install -g bower
sudo npm install -g grunt
npm install
bower install
```


Run import for maven dependancies.


## Notes

Note that code.google.code.twig is from a dead project to map POJOs to BigTable that needed
tweaks to remain functional.
