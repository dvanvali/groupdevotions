## Install

Start by installing npm and bower (if they are not in your path, you will need to hunt down the bin directory):

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
bower install
```

Run import for maven dependancies. 

You may need to also install grunt-cli

## Notes

Note that code.google.code.twig is from a dead project to map POJOs to BigTable that needed
tweaks to remain functional.
